These large areas are destined for the conservation, with a high degree of ecological integrity and habitat connectivity. 
Its mission is to maintain and sustain in the long term the integrity and functionality of the Valdivian Eco-region's environments at a landscape scale, consolidating a sustainable use of the resources inside and outside the protected areas with equity, active social participation, respect for cultural diversity and strengthening among the organizations that administer the territory."
