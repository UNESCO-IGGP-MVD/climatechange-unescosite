    txt = "The Araripe UNESCO Global Geopark is located in the Araripe Basin, which is considered the largest sedimentary basin in the Brazilian Northeast inland extending into the South of Ceará State, Pernambuco´s northwest and Piaui´s east. The Araripe Plateau is its main distinction, in terms of relief. The geological heritage of the Geopark is characterized by important geological records from the Lower Cretaceous period between 90 and 150 million years ago, especially in its paleontological content. The preservation of this vast and rich heritage of fossils in the region was caused by unique conditions during the geological evolution of Araripe Basin, especially in the Cretaceous. The paleobiology reveals great diversity, including silicified trunks, impressions of ferns, conifers and flowering plants, foraminifera, mollusks, arthropods (ostracódios, spiders, scorpions and insects), fish (sharks, rays, bony fishes and many celacantinos), amphibians and reptiles (turtles, lizards, crocodilians and pterosaurs). Sedimentary deposits preserve a great diversity of rocks (limestones, claystones, sandstones, thick deposits of gypsum) that are a record of geological environments that existed in this region."
